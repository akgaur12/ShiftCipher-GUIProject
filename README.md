# Shift Cipher GUI Project

The Shift Cipher GUI Project is a graphical user interface application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Shift Cipher encryption technique. The Shift Cipher, also known as the Caesar Cipher, is a simple encryption method that involves shifting each letter of the text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Explore the world of shift cipher encryption with this user-friendly GUI application!

## Features

- **User-friendly interface:** Easily input text and select the shift value for encryption and decryption.
- **Real-time updates:** See the encrypted and decrypted text as you input and adjust the shift value.
- **Encryption and decryption:** Encrypt plain text using the shift cipher technique and decrypt the encrypted text using the reverse shift.
- **Customizable shift value:** Choose the desired shift value for encryption, allowing for various levels of security.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the GUI application using `python shift_cipher_gui.py`.
4. Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt and select the shift value.
5. View the real-time updates of encrypted and decrypted text in the GUI.
